Ovens are a multiblock structure consisting of a $(thing)Bottom Oven$(), $(thing)Top Oven$(), and optionally $(thing)Chimneys$(). These blocks start off as clay, and must be $(thing)Cured$() by raising their temperature to a certain amount for long enough.$(br)$(l:firmalife/oven_appliances)Oven Appliances$() extend oven functionality."

Placing a stack of chimneys directly behind the oven causes the smoke from the oven to travel up and out of it.
